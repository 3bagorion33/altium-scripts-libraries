# Altium Designer addons

## What is it
This is a set of addons for Altium Designer, a CAD software for Electronic designers. This project contains some scripts, examples and other content which is developed to provide extended features for Altium Designer.\
No real consistency exists between each script because they have been developed separately by individual developers.
