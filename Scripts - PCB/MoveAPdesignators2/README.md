# MoveAPdesignators2
This script will change auto-positioned designators to manual and move them by a user-defined amount. Will operate on all or selected components.\
The direction of the movement depends on the current autoposition status.

*Taken from original MoveAPdesignators script*

- Added ability to set justification anchor so that changes to designator size or length grow in the same direction AutoPosition would grow (manual but smarter)
- Added 8 configurable preset values
- Remembers last-used settings
- Negative inputs move designators farther away from component instead of closer
- Works in AD 22.8.2+, not sure exactly what version introduced text justification for single strings

## How to install and use
_Step 1_: [DOWNLOAD](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Altium-Designer-addons/scripts-libraries/tree/master/Scripts%20-%20PCB/MoveAPdesignators2) script

_Step 2_: integrate the script into Altium Designer and execute it.\
If you are a newcomer to Altium scripts, [please read the "how to" wiki page](https://github.com/Altium-Designer-addons/scripts-libraries/wiki/HowTo_execute_scripts).

## Known Issues
- none known at this time

## Planned Features
- ~~Add an "Auto" option, maybe using `Function  PrimPrimDistance(APrimitive1 : IPCB_Primitive; APrimitive2 : IPCB_Primitive) : Integer;` to find shortest distance to pads or silkscreen?~~
  - **DONE for `InteractivelyAutoposition` procedure.**
- ~~Add interactive autopositioner mode that will let you click on a component, then click in one of 8 cardinal directions to set autoposition to that direction, optionally rotated to match component (hold Shift?)~~
  - **DONE**. Hold CTRL to ignore other components. Hold ALT for vertical placement.
- Implement Automatic distance adjustment for main procedure. My plan is to have it attempt an automatic move and if it fails to find an acceptable spot, it will fall back on the manual move distance input by the user.

## Auto Move
- Currently only implemented for `InteractivelyAutoposition` procedure. If AutoMove fails to find a clear spot closer to the component, it will leave it where autoposition dictates.

# Changelog
- 2022-11-28 - Ver 2.0 : Initial release based on MoveAPdesignators scrip Ver 1.2; uses new string justification settings and fixed bug with designator not actually moving coords; added presets and restore last used values
- 2022-11-28 - Ver 2.01 : fixed justification for rotated strings (approximated to nearest 90Â° rotation)
- 2022-11-28 - Ver 2.02 : *actually* fixed justification for rotated strings (I think)
- 2022-11-28 - Ver 2.03 : ***actually*** *actually* fixed justification and movement for rotated strings (my test PcbDoc was glitched where bottom side designators were mirrored in place or something)
- 2023-02-15 - Ver 2.04 : fixed support for moving designators away with negative input value; maybe, *possibly*, ***actually*** fixed justification and movement for the last time (*found a bug in Altium where components flipped to the other side of the board have the wrong autoposition behavior until the PcbDoc is closed and re-opened.*)
- 2023-06-20 - Ver 2.05 : added support for initially selecting a mix of designators and components, rather than only components; added support for AD19+ AdvanceSnapping text property (might actually fix previous justification bug); better memory safety
- 2023-06-28 - Ver 2.06 : added command to interactively adjust Designator Autoposition setting for components with automove
